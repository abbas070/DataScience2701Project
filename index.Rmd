# **Project: H-1B job market analysis**

For this project, I will perform a comprehensive analysis of H-1B visa job market using a massive dataset from the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). In this analysis, I will be looking specifically for H1-B employees in the United States, and as a result will conclude on which part of the United States offers the most jobs for H-1B qualified specialists, and whether there was an increase or decrease of such job offering through 2015-2016.  In addition, I will look at specific job titles and their correlation with several regions using a leaflet package in R.

## How to use:

The project consists of four major parts, which are divided into different stages. Please navigate through Stage One to Stage Four.

1. `Stage One` answers questions such as the purpose of the project, general information about the data, structure of the data, and instructions on how to access and use the data in accordance with reproducible research principles.  

2. `Stage Two` serves as a more in-depth data exploration, including data description, initial observations, sanity checks, and a discussion on next steps in the analysis.

3. `Stage Three` is a preliminary stage before the last one with sample techniques. In this sage, I discussed what advanced techniques are going to be used in the analysis, such as sampling distributions, analysis of textual data, and mashing up different sources of data.

4. `Stage Four` is the final statistical report of the analysis that includes data information and description, as well as implemented techniques such as geographical data using leaflet package and data mining techniques.
